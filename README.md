### 3. Big O #1
Calculating the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n.

### 4. Big O #2
Evaluating the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

### 5. Big O #3
Determining the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

### 6. Big O #4
