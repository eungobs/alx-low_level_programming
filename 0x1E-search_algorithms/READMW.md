Function to perform linear search in an array of integers.

### 1. Binary search
Function to perform binary search in a sorted array of integers.

### 2. Big O #0
Determining the time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n.

### 3. Big O #1
Calculating the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n.

### 4. Big O #2
Evaluating the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

### 5. Big O #3
Determining the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n.

### 6. Big O #4
Evaluating the space complexity of the provided function / algorithm.
